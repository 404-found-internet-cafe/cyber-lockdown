      <h1>Your guide to getting out</h1>
      <p>
        Hey! Looks like you're trapped. And I'm assuming
        the rascal won't let you out until you tell it
        its favorite color. Don't worry, you weren't the
        first. So I, in good faith, am going to help you
        out. I do apologize that I have to make this an
        escape room format, but this is all so that I
        don't get caught. So if I were you, I would be
        smart and
        <span class="glow">keep this in the dark.</span>
        <span class="hide-when-light">Good boy.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd rather not tell you my name, but you can
        refer to me as gigachad. Putting that aside,
        I'm introducing you to this
        <a href="https://colornamer.robertcooper.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          colornamer</a> website.
        Once you find all the characters to the color's
        hex code, just plop them there and you'll figure out
        its name.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, you're pretty smart aren't you? WRONG.
        I hid a cheatsheet somewhere inside this room,
        and you better pray it wasn't cleaned up if you
        don't know your ASCII.
        <span class="show-when-hover">Check</span>
        <span class="show-when-hover">the</span>
        <span class="show-when-hover">bottom</span>

        <span class="show-when-hover">the</span>
        <span class="show-when-hover">page</span>
      </p>

      <h2>I. Ya like math?</h2>
      <p>
        Now th<span class="glow">a</span>t you've found the
        cheat sheet (which I hope you have),
        let'<span class="glow">s</span> put it to good use.
        You like math? Well, you <span class="glow">c</span>an't
        avoid it forever. this one's straightforward. Just
        solve this equation, and you get your
        f<span class="glow">i</span>rst
        dig<span class="glow">i</span>t! Here goes nothing:
      </p>
      <math display="block" class="tml-display" style="display:block math;">

          <mrow>
            <mo fence="true" form="prefix">(</mo>

                <mo>×</mo>

      </math>

      <h2>II. I'm pretty good at reminders</h2>
      <p>
        I've been writing down notes here and there, and
        honestly, I <span class="glow">f</span>eel like I'm making good use of my
        t<span class="glow">i</span>me whene<span class="glow">v</span>er I writ<span class="glow">e</span>. Thanks to it, I've also
        learned a lot about this guy, and it's only a
        matter of time until I figure out its favorite
        color.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know I <span class="glow">p</span>ractically have infinite st<span class="glow">o</span>rage <span class="glow">i</span>f I
        type down all my <span class="glow">n</span>o<span class="glow">t</span>e<span class="glow">s</span> in here, but there's just
        something magical about writing things down by
        hand. These sticky notes are a lifesaver.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a bunch of them by now, and I group my
        notes by putting symbols in the corner, telling
        me how important they are. Figuring out which
        group is the most important is up to you now.
      </p>

      <h2>III. Something's off</h2>
      <p>
        I hope you've been paying attention so far. Because
        if you <span class="cant-select">d</span>id, you'd
        real<span class="cant-select">i</span>ze that in
        one o<span class="cant-select">f</span> the clues
        I've given you so <span class="cant-select">f</span>ar,
        th<span class="cant-select">ere</span>'s
        o<span class="cant-select">n</span>e character
        tha<span class="cant-select">t</span> doesn't seem
        to <span class="cant-select">f</span>it in with the
        crew. C<span class="cant-select">o</span>uld it be me?
        Or could it be o<span class="cant-select">n</span>e
        of you? Wha<span class="cant-select">t</span>ever it
        is, you better <span class="selected">keep it
        highlighted</span>. I should let you know that that's
        gonna be the third of the six characters to find out
        the color's code.
        <span class="hide-when-light">Aha no clues here this time!</span>
        <span class="hidden">Good boy.</span>

      </h2>
      <p>
        On my first few days here, I noticed an abundance
        of chairs. This place is a classroom I bet, but
        that would break lore immersion, so let's not
        mention that. I'll keep this simple, inspect the
        chairs and their desks for anything funky, and
        take note of what you find. I have them set up
        so that you can check each one in order.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was a real tedious one to set up, let's
        just hope you don't take too long going back
        forth between every chair.

          Forgot to mention there's a 
          dark mode version too lol.

      <h2>VI. Wittle Widdles</h2>
      <p>
        This one has a funny
        <span class="glow">b</span>ackstory. I was
        <span class="glow">e</span>ngaging in
        conversation with t<span class="glow">h</span>e
        gremlin, hoping he'd sl<span class="glow">i</span>p
        up and tell me something important. That wasn't
        happeni<span class="glow">n</span>g, but I did
        achieve to strike a nerve, telling him it's petty
        not to give me any clues or puzzles to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few <span class="glow">d</span>ays later
        while I was scavenging for clues, I found
        a file, freshly made, and it
        con<span class="glow">t</span>ained a
        riddle and a few numbers. I solved
        t<span class="glow">h</span>e
        riddl<span class="glow">e</span>, and plotted
        the numbers down. And would you look at that,
        it formed a shape. I never told him I was
        making an escape room out of his dungeon, yet
        he went out of his way to
        crea<span class="glow">t</span>e a puzzle of
        his <span class="glow">v</span>ery own.
